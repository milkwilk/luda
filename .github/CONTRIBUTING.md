## Communication Channels

Before starting your contributing journey,

__It's highly appreciated if anybody who has enough Stackoverflow reputations

## Using the Issue Tracker

[features requests](#feature-requests) and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests).

## Documentation

The documentation of Luda is written in Markdown, the Markdown files are in the
[`site/markdown`](https://github.com/oatw/luda/tree/develop/site/markdown)
directory of this repository.

I'm not a native English speaker,
I'm afraid there may be some
grammar mistakes and unclear expressions in the documents.
__It's a big thing to Luda if anyone can help
to improve the documentation.__ :collision: 

## Bug Reports

Please send your reports to [oatwoatw@gmail.com](mailto:oatwoatw@gmail.com) instead.

## Feature Requests

Your suggestion is important to Luda.
If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Luda,
you are probably not alone.
Open an issue on the issues list
which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Pull Requests

:thought_balloon: __Please describe your ideas before contributing your code to Luda__.
Are you going to add a new feature or fix a bug? How would you implement it?
You'd better start coding after getting a confirmation reply,
since unconfirmed pull requests may not be merged.

Luda follows the [Forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow).
You need fork this repository before embarking pull requests.
Only pull requests to the [`develop`](https://github.com/oatw/luda/tree/develop) branch will be merged.
So a new branch based on the `develop` branch is needed
when you're going to fix a bug or add a new feature.

Then, under the root of your local repo, run:

``` bash
# Check if necessary commands are able to be executed and install all dependencies.
$ npm run doctor
```
